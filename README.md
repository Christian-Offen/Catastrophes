# MATLAB plots of the first five elementary catastrophes

Run the provided scripts to plot models of

- a fold bifurcation (A2)
- a cusp bifurcation (A3)
- the swallow tail catastrophe (A4)
- the hyperbolic umbilic catastrophe (D4+)
- the elliptic umbilic catastrophe (D4-)

The provided scripts have been tested in MATLAB R2020a.

See annimations of the catastrophes on the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDZO7Vn4HynLKHkcSv7UWfA).

For a computation of cusps and hyperbolic umbilic bifurcations in a conjugate locus of a two- and three-dimensional ellipsoid, see the repository [Christian-Offen/ConjugateLocus](Christian-Offen/ConjugateLocus) or the corresponding [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2021.11.099).
